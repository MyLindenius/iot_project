## Tutorial on building a Temperature and Humidity Sensor IoT

# Brief overview
This project makes it possible to monitor the humidity and temperature in a room. The project also have a visual warning depending on the temperature to alert the user that the temperature is outside wanted values. My name is My Lindenius (ml227kw) and this IoT device has been built as a project for the course [Introduction Applied Internet of Things](https://lnu.se/kurs/tillampad-internet-of-things-introduktion/distans-internationell-engelska-sommar/) at Linn√© university.
