# Tutorial on building a Temperature and Humidity Sensor IoT

## Brief overview
This project makes it possible to monitor the humidity and temperature in a room. The project also have a visual warning depending on the temperature to alert the user that the temperature is outside wanted values. My name is My Lindenius (ml227kw) and this IoT device has been built as a project for the course [Introduction Applied Internet of Things](https://lnu.se/kurs/tillampad-internet-of-things-introduktion/distans-internationell-engelska-sommar/) at Linn√© university. This project would approximetly take 10 hours to complete having the solution available. Of course the time needed will also depend on prior knowledge and if any errors appear a long the way.

## Objective
I decided on this project as the data collected would be interesting and something that changes through out the day. This data is valuable for me as I have an animal with asthma, making it even more important to ensure proper humidity and temperature. This project can however also be valuable to anyone that want to ensure that their home has a good environment. I think this project will give an insight into how to build your own device that can communicate over the network and a nice introduction to the physical parts of a device.
